<h2 id="the-privacy-policy">The Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>I, BetterWebsites, care about privacy and wish to make this policy as inclusive of that goal as possible. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page">This is a static site</a>, meaning there is no database for data entry from a user of the site. Further, this site contains no Javascript and is arranged in HTML/CSS for maximizing security. <a href="https://pages.cloudflare.com/">This site is hosted on Cloudflare</a>. Cloudflare has their own analytics that are <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/privacy-first-web-analytics">&ldquo;privacy-first&rdquo;</a> and defines what data they collect and what they can know about you. They state that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cloudflare Web Analytics does not use any client-side state, such as cookies or localStorage, to collect usage metrics. We also don’t “fingerprint” individuals via their IP address, User Agent string, or any other data for the purpose of displaying analytics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash; <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/">Cloudflare Analytics</a></p>
<p>Cloudflare&rsquo;s privacy policy can be found on their website.</p>
<p>This site is built without cookies and does not contain any trackers. Embedded content (eg from YouTube, etc.) may contain their own cookies and trackers, and the linked sites own privacy policies will apply. Embedded content is akin to visiting the actual site itself, and the embedded sites privacy policy will apply.</p>
<p><strong>I do not collect any personally identifiable user information.</strong></p>
<p>Since I do not collect any <em>personally identifiable</em> information:</p>
<ul>
<li>there is no one to share or sell the information to</li>
<li>no place it is collected from (where)</li>
<li>no reason for the information to be collected (why)</li>
<li>no application of &ldquo;how information is collected&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s not collected in the first place</li>
<li>no application of &ldquo;rights users have over their data&rdquo; as it&rsquo;s not collected in the first place</li>
<li>You can contact me on Github if you have questions or concerns about this policy</li>
</ul>

<p>The legal code of the CC BY 4.0 license in section 5 states that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.</p>
<p>a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.</p>
<p>b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.</p>
<p>c.The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.</p>

<h3 id="fair-use">Fair Use</h3>
<p>This site may contain some copyrighted material from others. All such uses are intended to be either under public domain, license, agreement of copyright holder or used under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use">fair use doctrine</a>. <strong>No copyright infringement is intended</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>§107. Limitations on exclusive rights: Fair use
Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include—</p>
<p>(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;</p>
<p>(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;</p>
<p>(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and</p>
<p>(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.</p>
<p>The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors.</p>

<p>Section 512(f) of the DMCA creates liability for &ldquo;Any person who knowingly materially misrepresents under this section (1) that material or activity is infringing, or (2) that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification.&rdquo; If you were harmed by an improper takedown, you may be able to sue the person or company who sent the takedown demand for DMCA misuse under Section 512(f), and recover damages and your attorneys&rsquo; fees.
