- If an embedded item like a YouTube video is on a page, they may track you through that (embedded items are similar to visiting the actual site), and you are beholden to *their* policies.

## The Privacy Policy

I, {{< param name >}}, care about privacy and wish to make this policy as inclusive of that goal as possible. [This is a static site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page), meaning there is no database for data entry from a user of the site. Further, this site contains no Javascript and is arranged in HTML/CSS for maximizing security. [This site is hosted on Cloudflare](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). Cloudflare has their own analytics that are ["privacy-first"](https://blog.cloudflare.com/privacy-first-web-analytics) and defines what data they collect and what they can know about you. They state that:

> Cloudflare Web Analytics does not use any client-side state, such as cookies or localStorage, to collect usage metrics. We also don’t “fingerprint” individuals via their IP address, User Agent string, or any other data for the purpose of displaying analytics.

--- [Cloudflare Analytics](https://www.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/)

Cloudflare's privacy policy can be found on their website.

This site is built without cookies and does not contain any trackers. Embedded content (eg from YouTube, etc.) may contain their own cookies and trackers, and the linked sites own privacy policies will apply. Embedded content is akin to visiting the actual site itself, and the embedded sites privacy policy will apply.

**I do not collect any personally identifiable user information.**

Since I do not collect any *personally identifiable* information:

- there is no one to share or sell the information to
- no place it is collected from (where)
- no reason for the information to be collected (why)
- no application of "how information is collected" because it's not collected in the first place
- no application of "rights users have over their data" as it's not collected in the first place
- You can contact me on Github if you have questions or concerns about this policy

The license terms of other licenses, including limitation of liability and waivers, are applicable to the content which are licensed as such (MIT license for site theme, Unsplash license for certain images, CC0 where in use, etc.).

## Intellectual Property

As stated above, all my original material is (unless otherwise noted), under a [Creative Commons Attribution license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/):

Some of my images were published under the Unsplash License or CC0, which I used to use more heavily. Going forward, I am only using CC BY 4.0 for images.

Likewise, some of the content I have written in the past was licensed under CC0 or CC-BY-SA. I have included a notice when that content is used.

This site theme is under the [MIT license](/theme/LICENSE). Feel free to use it and share it!

If you decide to use my content under the CC BY 4.0, remember that if you alter it, you must indicate what was altered, and you cannot imply that I endorse it:

> No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

### Fair Use

This site may contain some copyrighted material from others. All such uses are intended to be either under public domain, license, agreement of copyright holder or used under the [fair use doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use). **No copyright infringement is intended**.


> §107. Limitations on exclusive rights: Fair use
Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include—
>
> (1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;
>
> (2) the nature of the copyrighted work;
>
> (3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and
>
> (4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.
>
>
> The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors.
>
> (Pub. L. 94–553, title I, §101, Oct. 19, 1976, 90 Stat. 2546; Pub. L. 101–650, title VI, §607, Dec. 1, 1990, 104 Stat. 5132; Pub. L. 102–492, Oct. 24, 1992, 106 Stat. 3145.)

Note that you may not make false claims of copyright infringement under the DMCA:

> Section 512(f) of the DMCA creates liability for "Any person who knowingly materially misrepresents under this section (1) that material or activity is infringing, or (2) that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification." If you were harmed by an improper takedown, you may be able to sue the person or company who sent the takedown demand for DMCA misuse under Section 512(f), and recover damages and your attorneys' fees.
