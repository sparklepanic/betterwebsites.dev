This is the betterwebsites theme. This is a simple gohugo theme that I’ve been wanting to develop for some time. It doesn’t use a CSS framework but a smallish custom CSS file, uses a system font stack (and also defaults to load Atkinson Hyperlegible if the user has it installed on their system), contains no Javascript, utilizes bootstrap icons through SVG, respects dark vs light mode of the user, loads fast, and follows a minimalist/utilitarian/brutalist design. All while looking great and being responsive, supporting modern browsers. Importantly, it tries to follow a designed-to-last mentality. -Raven Winters
