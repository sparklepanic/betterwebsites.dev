<h3>do not be afraid...</h3>

<blockquote>
I must not fear. <br>
Fear is the mind-killer. <br>
Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. <br>
I will face my fear. <br>
I will permit it to pass over me and through me. <br>
And when it has gone past, I will turn the inner eye to see its path. <br>
Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. <br>
Only I will remain. <br>
</blockquote>

— <em>The Litany Against Fear</em> as written by Frank Herbert in <em>Dune</em> (1965)
